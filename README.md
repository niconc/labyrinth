# Labyrinth

A different binary tree proposal. Using the traditional data structure tree as a base, but with different methodology of Node checking and especially Node go to.

**I am neither using nor have to use binary searching at all!** No tree modeling, no balance, sort or in general what the tree looks like. It's like *"I don't care about tree's shape or other parameters"*, because the way I'm access it is totally different. By knowing where everything is in advance, I am just following a thread to get to the Node. I am neither using nor have to use binary searching at all!

Inspired by the ancient Greek mythology legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth" target="_blank">Labyrinth</a> and the way Theseus walked out the monstrous, confusing structure. 

**Build for demonstrating purposes of my skillset in Go.**

## Installation.
As usual, clone with the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/niconc/labyrinth.git
```

## Usage.
**Step #1.**
Open `terminal` or `iterm` or any terminal emulator, and run the server with the following command:
```
$ go run labyrinth.go

```
**Step #2.**
Edit the file and see how it is implemented. You need a Go supporting editor and little to not-so little Go knowlwdge.
Written in Go.
